# Sleep Apnea Predictor

Sleep Apnea predictive model using data from the STAGES sleep study. Initially a project for a ML class, I wanted to redo it with a more analytical and exploratory approach using the extra knowledge I have learned since taking it.

The repository for the initial project is private as it relied on the presence of the STAGES dataset that I am not allowed to publicize. Instead of significantly refactoring it in order to be public, I thought it would be better to simply start it over from the ground up; once completed it will be a complete replacement.

Notes on Usage

- The datasets provided must be personally acquired from the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR). When downloaded to the `./data` directory (will result in `/data/stages/`), the notebooks containing data preparation and exploration shall function properly.

# Feature Engineering Log

Starting with the Demographics subset

- all columns with >80% missing are not being considered right now

## Initial Notes

height in feet, height in inches, weight, and bmi are all different features and a subset should be selected. this will require more analysis later but is worth noting now.

Need to combine work and school columns

New columns to make:

- Day start time:
  - need a way to encode this feature to be meaningful eventually; just unify it for now I think
- Day end time:
- Days per week in work/school
-

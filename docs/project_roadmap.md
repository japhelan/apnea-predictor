# Project Roadmap

## data prep

1. initial data inspection

   1. correct initial easy errors
   2. join datasets
   3. document initial dataset

2. shape and structure dataset

   1. make sure in standard structure (figure out time series features?)
   2. maybe try to figure out pivot tables

3. document initial stuff

   1. replace all placeholder NaNs with real NaNs
   2. make sure all measurements are of the same unit
   3. make sure datatypes are correct
   4. validate value ranges and duplicates
   5. save a checkpoint and note the unresolved issues

for now, don't make any drastic changes to the data.

## EDA

1. classify variables
2. univariate analysis

   1. want estimates of location and estimates of variabiltiy
   2. descriptiive statistics
   3. univariate visualizations
   4. univariate variable diagnostics

      1. Missing value identification and
         characterization
      2. Outlier detection
      3. Domain-specific anomaly detection
      4. Distribution shape analysis
      5. Frequency analysis

3. Bivariate and multivariate analysis

   1. Bivariate visualizations
   2. Multivariate visualizations
   3. Bivariate/multivariate diagnostics
